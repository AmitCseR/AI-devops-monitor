## What is this project?
This is a simple AI application that generates images from text descriptions. The most important part of this project is the automated DevOps pipeline that deploys any code changes automatically.

## Technologies I Used:
- Python
- Gradio
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)

## How the Automation Works (The DevOps Magic):
1.  I write new code on my computer.
2.  I push the code to GitHub.
3.  A GitHub Action (my automatic factory) starts instantly.
4.  It builds the app and pushes it to Hugging Face Spaces.
5.  The new version is live for the world in minutes!
